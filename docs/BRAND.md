# Kerniflow — Brand (minimal starter)

**Positioning:** an AI-native “kernel” you can extend from freelancer workflows → full ERP.

**Tone:** calm, precise, trustworthy.

**Visual direction (starter):**
- Primary: near-black UI (dark-first)
- Accent: “electric teal” feel (use sparingly)
- Typography: modern sans (system is fine for now)

This is intentionally minimal so you can iterate without churn.
